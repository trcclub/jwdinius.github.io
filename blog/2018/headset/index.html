  <article class="post-content">
    <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>I had been looking into the Oculus Rift + Touch for awhile, but I knew next-to-nothing about the math behind its tracking algorithms.  A few months back, I read a Medium article where some guys had built their own inexpensive open-source virtual reality headset.  I found the project on <a href="https://github.com/relativty/Relativ">Github</a>, looked through their implementation and saw that there wasn’t much in the way of headset tracking, yet.  I saw that they used an IMU - inertial measurement unit - for estimating rotations from raw measurements.  From my experience with tracking systems, this seemed a suboptimal approach because of sensor noise, bias, etc… so I decided to dig-in deep and add inertial tracking.  Doing this, I believed, would improve the VR experience by avoiding spurious orientation estimates due to IMU issues.  In this post, I will talk about my experience researching and implementing a tracking filter in the project.  See <a href="https://github.com/relativty/Relativ/blob/master/src/main/main.ino">here</a> for the algorithm implementation.</p>

<h3 id="the-approach-with-all-of-the-gory-math">The Approach, with all of the Gory Math</h3>
<p>The approach I’m going to discuss can be found <a href="http://vr.cs.uiuc.edu/vrch9.pdf">here</a>.  As a prereq, you should have a background in the mathematics of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Quaternion.html">quaternions</a>, because the approach I took utilizes them heavily.  Briefly, a quaternion can be thought of as an object that parametrizes a rotation.  Firstly, there is an <em>axis of rotation</em>, which is a unit vector <script type="math/tex">\hat{\mathbf{v}}</script> that a point, or set of points, is rotated about.  The second parameter of a quaternion is the <em>angle of rotation</em>, a scalar <script type="math/tex">\theta</script>.  Putting these two things together, we have a quaternion <script type="math/tex">\tilde{q}(\mathbf{v}, \theta)</script> that describes a rotation <em>about</em> <script type="math/tex">\hat{\mathbf{v}}</script> with magnitude <script type="math/tex">0 \le \theta \le 2 \pi</script>.  Quaternions are conceptually similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix">Euler rotation matrices</a>, however <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#Ambiguities">quaternions are preferred</a> because of some undesirable properties of rotation matrices.</p>

<p>My first step when trying to improve upon existing projects is usually to understand what data is available already.  The project already included an IMU, either the <a href="https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/MPU-6050">6-axis MPU-6050</a> or the <a href="https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/MPU-9150">9-axis MPU-9150</a>, which output an acceleration vector - 3 axes, an angular velocity vector - 3 more axes, and, for the MPU-9150, a magnetic direction vector - 3 more axes.  I will discuss the contribution of all of these measurement quantities in course, but I will begin with the angular velocity vector, <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{\omega}</script>.</p>

<p align="center"> 
<img src="/assets/img/coords.png">
</p>

<p>See above for a picture representing <em>global</em> and <em>local</em>, or <em>body</em>, coordinate systems.  The global frame has coordinates with “primes”, e.g. <script type="math/tex">x'</script>.  <em>Important</em>:  The above image is stock; for the discussions below, replace <script type="math/tex">z</script> in the above image with <script type="math/tex">y</script>, <script type="math/tex">x</script> with <script type="math/tex">z</script>, and <script type="math/tex">y</script> with <script type="math/tex">x</script>.</p>

<p>A note on notation:  I use <script type="math/tex">\hat{-}</script>’s for unit vectors and <script type="math/tex">\tilde{-}</script>’s for estimated quantities.</p>

<p>The angular velocity vector, <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{\omega}</script>, is a measurement of angular rotation rates about a set of principle axes, aka a body coordinate system.  <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{\omega} \equiv [\omega_x, \omega_y, \omega_z]^T</script>.  As with most sensors, the output needs to be calibrated to account for temperature effects, bias, scaling, etc…  The calibrated measurement, <script type="math/tex">\tilde{\mathbf{\omega}}</script>, can be written as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\tilde{\mathbf{\omega}} = A \mathbf{\omega} + \mathbf{b}</script>

<p><script type="math/tex">A</script> is a <script type="math/tex">3 \times 3</script>-matrix and <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script> is a <script type="math/tex">3 \times 1</script> bias vector.  The coefficients of <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script> are determined during a <a href="https://github.com/kkpoon/CalibrateMPU6050">calibration</a> procedure.  The normalized vector</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\hat{\mathbf{v}} = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{\omega}}}{||\tilde{\mathbf{\omega}}||}</script>

<p>forms the axis of rotation of a quaternion, and the amount of angle change over the current timestep, <script type="math/tex">\Delta t</script>, 
<script type="math/tex">\Delta \tilde{\theta}_k = ||\tilde{\mathbf{\omega}}|| \Delta t</script>, is the magnitude of rotation of the <em>same</em> quaternion.</p>

<p>This quaternion, <script type="math/tex">\Delta \tilde{q}_k \equiv q(\hat{\mathbf{v}}, \Delta \tilde{\theta}_k)</script>, represents an incremental change in estimated orientation from a previous state described by the quaternion <script type="math/tex">\tilde{q}_{k-1}</script>.  The orientation at the current timestep, <script type="math/tex">k \Delta t</script>, can be updated recursively</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\tilde{q}_k = \Delta \tilde{q}_k * \tilde{q}_{k-1}</script>

<p>where <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> is the quaternion product and, yes, order does matter.  This is because quaternion algebra, like matrix algebra, is non-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group">Abelian</a>.</p>

<p>Ok, so we have a quaternion that represents the <em>estimated</em> headset’s orientation at some timestep, <script type="math/tex">k \Delta t</script> based on the calibrated angular velocity reading.  It turns out that these estimates can become unreliable over time due to a phenomena known as <a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/16105/what-affects-imu-inertial-measurement-unit-accuracy">IMU drift</a>.  This drift error in our estimate can be decomposed as tilt and yaw errors.  The tilt error, denoted <script type="math/tex">d_{tilt}</script>, is the magnitude of difference between the estimated quaternion and truth in the <a href="http://www.machinedesign.com/engineering-essentials/what-s-difference-between-pitch-roll-and-yaw">pitch and roll</a> channels, whereas yaw error, <script type="math/tex">d_{yaw}</script>, comes from the remaining yaw channel.  Since these channels represent rotations about orthogonal axes, the total error, <script type="math/tex">d</script>, can be written as the product of quaternions, <script type="math/tex">d = d_{tilt} * d_{yaw}</script>.  Somewhat confusingly, order does not matter here, because whether you apply the yaw or tilt correction first, the end result will be the same.</p>

<p>I have only considered the <em>true</em> drift error in the previous paragraph.  In practice, however, one can usually only compute an estimate of the drift errors discussed.  I will now go through how to compute these estimates.</p>

<p>Tilt error is due to the estimated “up” vector, <script type="math/tex">\tilde{\mathbf{u}} = [\tilde{u}_x, \tilde{u}_y, \tilde{u}_z]</script>, being out-of-alignment with the <em>actual</em> “up” vector, the <script type="math/tex">+y</script>-axis.  If the IMU is only rotating, not translating, this is an ok approach, but it will break down if the IMU is accelerating.  This approach hinges on the fact that the measured IMU acceleration needs to be very nearly the 9.8 meters-per-second-squared of gravitational acceleration.  For a VR headset, if the wearer is seated in a chair, this seems a decent assumption.  The vector <script type="math/tex">\tilde{\mathbf{u}}</script> is computed by rotating the calibrated acceleration measurement vector <script type="math/tex">\tilde{\mathbf{a}}</script> into global coordinates:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\tilde{\mathbf{u}} = \tilde{q}_k * \tilde{\mathbf{a}} * \tilde{q}_k^{-1}</script>

<p>Now, the angular difference between the global <script type="math/tex">y</script>-axis and <script type="math/tex">\tilde{\mathbf{u}}</script> can be computed with the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LawofCosines.html">law-of-cosines</a>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\tilde \phi = \cos^{-1} \bigl ( \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{u}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{y}}}{||\tilde{\mathbf{u}}||} \bigr ),</script>

<p>with <script type="math/tex">\hat{\mathbf{y}} = [0, 1, 0]^T</script>.  We have the rotation angle for our quaternion, now we need the axis.  The tilt-axis, <script type="math/tex">\tilde{\mathbf{t}}</script> is the vector we need to rotate about to bring <script type="math/tex">\tilde{\mathbf{u}}</script> and <script type="math/tex">\hat{\mathbf{y}}</script> into alignment.  Such an axis would need to be orthogonal to <em>both</em> <script type="math/tex">\tilde{\mathbf{u}}</script> and <script type="math/tex">\hat{\mathbf{y}}</script>.  There are two choices based upon directionality, the one associated with the <em>positive</em> rotation -from <script type="math/tex">\tilde{\mathbf{u}}</script> <em>towards</em> <script type="math/tex">\hat{\mathbf{y}}</script>- is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\tilde{\mathbf{t}} = \begin{bmatrix}
\tilde{u}_z \\
0 \\
-\tilde{u}_x \\
\end{bmatrix}</script>

<p>The tilt error can now be written as a quaternion:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\tilde{d}_{tilt} = q \bigl ( \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}}{||\tilde{\mathbf{t}}||}, \hat \phi \bigr )</script>

<h4 id="tilded_yaw-but-only-if-you-have-the-mpu-9150-or-equivalent">
<script type="math/tex">\tilde{d}_{yaw}</script>, but only if you have the MPU-9150, or equivalent</h4>
<p>Tilt error only estimates drift in pitch and roll, but what about yaw?  A priori knowledge about gravity won’t help here, so the measured acceleration won’t be of any use.  If we were able to have some way of recognizing a landmark in the <script type="math/tex">xz</script>-plane with the IMU, then we could compare our estimate of that landmark’s position to our a priori estimate.  The magnetic north-pole is such a landmark, and if we have the MPU-9150, or equivalent, we have a magnetic compass that will generate a calibrated measurement, <script type="math/tex">\tilde{\mathbf{m}}</script>, 
that we can rotate and compare to true north.  We can define our global coordinate system such that the <script type="math/tex">z</script>-axis is aligned <em>opposite</em> to true north.  Our estimate of true north, <script type="math/tex">\tilde{\mathbf{n}}</script> then follows much the same as the tilt error calculations:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\tilde{\mathbf{n}} = \tilde{q}_k * \tilde{\mathbf{m}} * \tilde{q}_k^{-1},</script>

<p>from which we compute an angular offset:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\hat \psi = \cos^{-1} \bigl ( \frac{-\tilde{\mathbf{n}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{z}}}{||\tilde{\mathbf{n}}||} \bigr ).</script>

<p>The axis of rotation is just <script type="math/tex">\hat{\mathbf{y}}</script>, the yaw axis, from which the estimated yaw drift is computed:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\tilde{d}_{yaw} = q \bigl ( \hat{\mathbf{y}}, \hat \psi \bigr )</script>

<p>If the magnetic compass reading is not available, <script type="math/tex">\tilde{d}_{yaw}</script> is set to the identity quaternion.</p>

<h4 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all Together</h4>
<p>The estimated error quaternion, <script type="math/tex">\tilde{d}</script>, can be deconstructed into a rotation axis and an angle.  Let’s call the angle $\theta$ and the axis <script type="math/tex">\hat{\mathbf{v}}</script>.  Using these quantities, we can construct a <em>complementary estimate</em></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\tilde{q}_k' = q(\hat{\mathbf{v}}, -\alpha \theta) * \tilde{q}_k</script>

<p>with <script type="math/tex">\alpha</script> as a weighting factor with <script type="math/tex">0 \le \alpha \le 1</script>.  Increasing <script type="math/tex">\alpha</script> will more heavily compensate for drift in your estimate.</p>

<p>The parameter <script type="math/tex">\alpha</script> should be selected heuristically; literally, an “eyeball-test”. <img class="emoji" title=":smiley:" alt=":smiley:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f603.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<h3 id="the-implementation">The Implementation</h3>
<p>You can check out the actual implementation <a href="https://github.com/relativty/Relativ/blob/master/src/main/main.ino">here</a>.</p>

<p>I would like to point out just a few things about the <a href="https://www.i2cdevlib.com/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">i2cdev</code></a> library:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It has a pretty nice API.  The <code class="highlighter-rouge">get*</code>’s and <code class="highlighter-rouge">set*</code>’s are well named and use camel-case consistently.  Additionally, A lot of methods for accessing raw measurements and computing intermediate estimates from them are exposed.  For example, the gravity estimate associated with the current orientation quaternion can be polled directly with <code class="highlighter-rouge">dmpGetGravity(&amp;,&amp;)</code>, which returns the estimated “up” vector.</li>
  <li>Quaternions and vectors are supported out-of-the-box, with methods to do useful things like normalization, compute products, etc…</li>
  <li>For the most part, everything is very simple and intuitive.</li>
</ul>

<p>All necessary math operations were provided by either <code class="highlighter-rouge">i2cdev</code> or Arduino; no custom functions were written.  This was really nice because I feel it made the implementation cleaner and easier to work through.</p>

<h3 id="parting-thoughts">Parting Thoughts</h3>
<p>If you have made it this far, then congratulations are in order!  The details in this post can be very difficult to get through without a significant background in rotational math; specifically quaternions and vectors.  I have tried to pare down the explanation to only the bits that I found essential.  I have also tried, whenever possible, to include pictures so that you, the reader, could visualize what was going on.</p>

<p>I wanted to write this post in an ongoing effort to engage my mind in thinking on how to explain what I work on so that most others can understand.  In that sense it is mostly for me, but in another sense I really do want to ensure that someone reading this would find something that they could recall and refer back to when working on similar problems.  If you feel something could be clearer, please let me know.  Thanks for reading!</p>
